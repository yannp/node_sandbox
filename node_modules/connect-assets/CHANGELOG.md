# Changes By Release

## 5.2.1
* Added more explanation for using the compile option from the CLI.

## 5.2.0
* Updates all core dependencies to the latest:
  * `argparse`: `1.0.2` -> `1.0.7`
  * `csswring`: `3.0.5` -> `4.2.2`
  * `mincer`: `1.3.0` -> `1.4.1`
  * `uglify-js: `2.4.23` -> `2.6.2`
  * `postcss`: `5.0.19` (new dependency)
* Changes `build` option to correctly manage whether the assets are saved to disk
* Adds `bundle` option to manage whether the assets are bundled under a single tag (used to actually be controlled by the `build` option)
* Adds support for inline styles and scripts (`jsInline` and `cssInline`), thanks to @iamjochem

### Upgrade Notes
For the majority of people, the changes to `build` option and the addition of `bundle` option should "just work". However, just providing a `buildDir` will no longer start saving assets to disk; the `build` option must also be enabled.

## 5.1.1
* Fix for compile=true ignoring already built asset (#322), thanks to @dapriett
* Fix for serving source maps, thanks to @inukshuk
